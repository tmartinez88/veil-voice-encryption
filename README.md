Encrypt
to encrypt some audio first click generate key. This will scramble frequency bins. Write the key to the desktop (you will need it to decrypt the audio, send to a friend) - to do this click “Write Key”.

Click open secretmessage.wav wave to save your sound file. Click the toggle box next to “record audio” and record your message.  

Decrypt
to decrypt “read” the key into the text object. Drag and drop the encrypted audio onto the drop file object.

Also scramble amplitude of frequency bin.


Use a carrier song (such as a pop song) to add an additional layer of scrambling to the spectral layer. The song would be agreed upon by both sender and recipient beforehand.
